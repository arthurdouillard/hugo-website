The most prestigious prize of french literature, the Goncourt prize, was awarded in 2021 for this book.
The subject of the book is about a lost african writer author of a mythical book decades ago.
Ironically, it won in final against "Le voyant d'Etampes", whose base synopsis is the same.

This book is well written, with a vocabulary ranging from the vulgar to rare words
(I'd not recommend this book if you're not fluent in french).

Its main forte is how multiple stories were imbricated: a character talk about another character which talks
about another... and despite this russian dolls structure, we are seldom lost.

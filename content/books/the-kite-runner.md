First book of Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini, the story starts in
an Afghanistan I've never known: not particularly rich, but stable, with movies,
and a relative religion liberty. The narrator, son of a rich merchant, is unsufferable
but his behavior as a young man will become a burden to the man he'll become. And this
burden will have to be lifted through the adversity of the Talibans.

Characters are realistic and their story in chaos that follow the coup dethroning the king
is poignant. My only regret is that some ellipses are too big, and I'd liked to know
even more.

I have been recommended often Zweig, and I recently started to learn more seriously chess.
Therefore, the first book I read written by Zweig shall be "The Royal Game", a book
about the madness induced by chess to an ordinary man.

The style is simple to follow, and the excitation created by the parties the characters
engage into is contagious.

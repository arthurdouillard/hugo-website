# About me

I'm a coder, a scientist, and a teacher. Currently a PhD student at Sorbonne University Professor Matthieu Cord, I research how to train Deep Neural Networks continually. I'm also working
part-time as a Research Scientist at Heuritech, deploying convolution nets for fashion. And finally, I am
a lecturer in Parisian engineering school EPITA where I teach Computer Vision.

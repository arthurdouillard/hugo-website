# About me

I love learning continuously.

Therefore I've created a [free course](https://arthurdouillard.com/deepcourse/) on deep learning for computer vision using Anki flashcards to improve my students' learning.

While not trying to improve human learning, I'm working at DeepMind in London on
Continual Learning for machines.

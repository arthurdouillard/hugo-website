# About me

I'm a coder, a scientist, and a teacher. I've defended my PhD in Deep Learning
from Sorbonne Universit√© in June 2022 and I research how to train Deep Neural
Networks continually. I'll be joining DeepMind in August as a Research Scientist.

I've released this course for free at [deepcourse](https://arthurdouillard.com/deepcourse/).
